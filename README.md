## Problem definition

#### Problem definition:

1. Limited accessibility via mobile device
2. out of date website
3. No existing booking calendar
4. No existing dynamic social media feed into the homepage
5. No existing searchable service area feature
6. Has to be user/non coding friendly for client to manage contents by herself (i.e. Currently using Wix to make website.

#### Solution:
Implementing/resolving all of the above using the most recent technology using the javascript MERN stack, to work with all modern devices. Headless CMS (Content Management System) will enable client to easily update content on the web app by herself without understanding the code. API’s for implementing external content, such as facebook, instagram, twitter, google maps, shopify, will enable more content to be available on clients app, making their products more accessible to potential clients.
